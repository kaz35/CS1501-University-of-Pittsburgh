The word search game is very easy to play. The rules are as follows:

1) Pick a character on the board to start searching from.
2) From the character you picked, go in any of the possible eight directions, adding up the characters as you go.
NOTE: The eight directions are up, down, left, right, and the 4 diagonals.
ALSO, once you go in a specific direction, you CANNOT change direction halfway through.
3) If the phrase you found is at least 4 letters long, or is equal to or less than 10, and is a dictionary word, you have found a word on the board!
4) If your prase includes a wildcard, denoted by an asterisk '*', then that can count for any alphabet character! Multiple words are possible.

You can pick any letter and any directions. The goal of the game is to find all the possible words on the board!

Good luck!
